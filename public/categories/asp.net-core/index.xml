      <description>Background Most of us are all &amp;ldquo;slackers&amp;rdquo;, meaning we truly do spend a significant amount of time using Slack.
Slack is a collaboration hub for work, no matter what work you do. It’s a place where conversations happen, decisions are made, and information is always at your fingertips. www.slack.com It&amp;rsquo;s wildly popular in the Developer Community! In fact, almost to a fault&amp;hellip;people are constantly sharing their &amp;ldquo;slack fatigue&amp;rdquo;. I am personally a part of roughly twenty slack workspaces.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to share that this post is part of the C# Advent Calendar and it&amp;rsquo;s my second year contributing to it! I encourage you to check out all the others here .
Developers Are Lazy In the world of web development it is hard to escape certain tools that we are forced to rely on. As developers we&amp;rsquo;re innately lazy and it is safe to say that perhaps we don&amp;rsquo;t really care enough to look into other tooling options.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core &#43; Angular Photo Booth App</title>
      <link>https://davidpine.net/blog/photo-booth/</link>

      <description>Inspiration I recently returned from Charleston, South Carolina &amp;ndash; where I spoke at SyntaxCon. The event was very professionally organized and gave me inspiration for Cream City Code. In the main hall, they had a HALO by Simple Booth . It serves as a photo booth with a conference-specific backdrop &amp;ndash; which is perfect for sharing the conference experience. I looked into purchasing one but was encouraged to simply write my own&amp;hellip; so I did and this blog will detail that process.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core Unit Testing For Security Attributes</title>
      <link>https://davidpine.net/blog/asp-net-core-security-unit-testing/</link>

      <description>Intro As a developer, I can say that developers are lazy - at least I know and acknowledge that I am. If I&amp;rsquo;m tasked with something even the slightest bit repetitious I&amp;rsquo;ll script it out, or find a way to automate it. Likewise, if I fall into a habit of forgetting something important - I&amp;rsquo;ll figure out a way to not forget. Especially when it comes to securing an application.</description>

      <description>Being a software developer, it&amp;rsquo;s in our nature to configure various aspects of the applications that we write. With ASP.NET Core configuring our applications is really straight forward. Luckily, there is a lot of really well written documentation surrounding this topic.
ASP.NET Core - Configuration ASP.NET Core - Options However, there is still room for improvement. I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a few tips that can enhance developer productivity by taking advantage of various C# features.</description>

      <title>Overriding ASP.NET Core Framework-Provided Services</title>
      <link>https://davidpine.net/blog/overriding-default-di/</link>

      <description>Overview In .NET it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to create your own interfaces and implementations. Likewise, it&amp;rsquo;s seemingly effortless to register them for dependency injection. But it is not always obvious how to override existing implementations. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss various aspects of &amp;ldquo;dependency injection&amp;rdquo; and how you can override the &amp;ldquo;framework-provided services&amp;rdquo;.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent story on our product backlog for building a security audit of login attempts. The story involved the capture of attempted usernames along with their corresponding IP addresses.</description>

      <title>What happened to my Thread.CurrentPrincipal</title>

      <description>Overview Like the title claims, if you&amp;rsquo;re using ASP.NET Core and expecting the Thread.CurrentPrincipal or ClaimsPrincipal.Current to be populated you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong. This is not the IPrincipal you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss what happened and what you need to do now. Additionally we&amp;rsquo;ll cover all the peripheral benefits as a result of this change.
History If you have ever done any .NET Framework development, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen the Thread class.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core Response Optimization</title>
      <link>https://davidpine.net/blog/asp-net-core-optimization/</link>

      <guid>https://davidpine.net/blog/asp-net-core-optimization/</guid>
      <description>Intro If you&amp;rsquo;re a web developer, chances are you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with optimization strategies such as static file caching and response compression. I recently implemented these two concepts in tandem on an ASP.NET Core application that I have been developing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to share what I have learned.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to use ASP.NET Core yet, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out! As my friend Scott Addie likes to say:
ASP.NET Core is a cafeteria plan in which developers choose application dependencies à la carte.</description>

      <description>Introduction As I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re all aware by now, Monday June 27th was a special day for those of you who were anticipating the release of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. While the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; frameworks and runtimes are RTM, the tooling is actually still in preview. In fact, we&amp;rsquo;re currently on Tools Preview 2. I wanted to focus this post entirely on one specific enhancement to Visual Studio solutions, enter the global.</description>

      <description>Introduction On Monday, May 16th 2016 there was an amazing announcement from the .NET Blog team!
Announcing .NET Core RC2 and .NET Core SDK Preview 1
This post will serve as a guide that walks you through the steps as I experienced them from migrating existing ASP.NET Core RC1 applications to ASP.NET Core RC2. It is worth mentioning that I&amp;rsquo;m am targeting the .NET 4.6 framework. So, I do not cover the .</description>
