      <description>The Story Behind The Game I have three sons. Lyric who is six and a half, Londyn who is four and half, and Lennyx who is two and half. As you might imagine, they seldom agree on things. For example when it&amp;rsquo;s family move night, &amp;ldquo;which movie we&amp;rsquo;ll watch?&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;who gets to go first?&amp;rdquo; when playing a game. These important life decisions are often decided by playing the color guessing game.</description>

      <description>I recently decided to give creating videos a test drive. The problem with creating video content is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s really time consuming to do, but the time investment can be worth the effort if you&amp;rsquo;re able to truly deliver some sort of value. Another problem we&amp;rsquo;re faced with in the technical community is that videos can be very lengthy. Enter DMP in 3, a video series of 3 minute videos.</description>

      <description>Intro I love working with the Angular HttpClient. It is easy to use and was designed to work with RxJS. It is vastly different from the AngularJS implementation, if you&amp;rsquo;re curious I wrote about these differences . However, there is one common issue that developers fall victim to. The issue really relates to TypeScript generics. I have also written about generics in TypeScript here . But in this post, we will reveal how the issue can easily be avoided.</description>

      <description>If you have been following the development efforts of the Angular2 project, you have witnessed certain highs and lows - but it has been a fun ride. The latest version is only a Release Candidate and the team is getting closer to the final release. I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to that! I wanted to take a moment to highlight (IMO) one of the key services of Angular2, the http service.</description>
