      <description>Intro With more than 40 million active users, GitHub is by far the largest source code hosting platform in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s an open source developers dream, and ecosystem and developer community unlike any other. And with all these users and such profound openness, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be frustration from time to time. In this post we will explore an Azure Function written with ASP.NET Core 3.0 and C# 8.0. It has been designed to handle a GitHub webhook for issues and pull requests.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to share that this post is part of the C# Advent Calendar and it&amp;rsquo;s my second year contributing to it! I encourage you to check out all the others here .
 Developers Are Lazy In the world of web development it is hard to escape certain tools that we are forced to rely on. As developers we&amp;rsquo;re innately lazy and it is safe to say that perhaps we don&amp;rsquo;t really care enough to look into other tooling options.</description>

      <description>Intro Monday, August 14thwas an amazing day to be a .NET developer! As the world celebrates another triumphant series of announcements from Microsoft, there is still confusion amongst the masses.
 What is this .NET Standard thing? What does it mean to target .NET Standard versus .NET Core, or even the .NET Framework? As a developer, what .NET should I target and why? Are Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) dead? Developer Community All of these questions have already been answered, you just have to know where to look.</description>

      <title>Overriding ASP.NET Core Framework-Provided Services</title>

      <description>Overview In .NET it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to create your own interfaces and implementations. Likewise, it&amp;rsquo;s seemingly effortless to register them for dependency injection. But it is not always obvious how to override existing implementations. Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss various aspects of &amp;ldquo;dependency injection&amp;rdquo; and how you can override the &amp;ldquo;framework-provided services&amp;rdquo;.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s take a recent story on our product backlog for building a security audit of login attempts. The story involved the capture of attempted usernames along with their corresponding IP addresses.</description>

      <title>What happened to my Thread.CurrentPrincipal</title>

      <description>Overview Like the title claims, if you&amp;rsquo;re using ASP.NET Core and expecting the Thread.CurrentPrincipal or ClaimsPrincipal.Current to be populated you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong. This is not the IPrincipal you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss what happened and what you need to do now. Additionally we&amp;rsquo;ll cover all the peripheral benefits as a result of this change.
History If you have ever done any .NET Framework development, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen the Thread class.</description>

      <description>Inspiration I am certainly not the first one to create a magic mirror, and I will not be the last either. I was inspired by those who are true Innovators&amp;hellip;some might say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m standing on the shoulders of giants&amp;rdquo;. They would probably we right, and I&amp;rsquo;m okay with that. Earlier this year, I stumbled upon a tweet about someone how created a magic mirror&amp;hellip;this is the root of my inspiration.</description>
